##Resources for Data Journalism Syllabi

- The American Press Institute has an excellent 2016 series, [Diving into Data Journalism: Strategies for getting started or going deeper](https://www.americanpressinstitute.org/publications/reports/strategy-studies/data-journalism/). A great quote from that series that removes some of the mist and mystique: "There are two basic skills needed to get started as a data journalist: the ability to engage in critical thinking and basic familiarity with spreadsheets" -- sorting, filtering and basic math.
- An obvious starting point -- and even ending point -- might be [The Data Journalism Handbook](http://datajournalismhandbook.org/1.0/en/). An initiative of the European Journalism Centre and the Open Knowledge Foundation, it is published by O'Reilly Media and freely available in numerous languages online under Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license.
- A great post by Simon Rogers on [Can Data Journalism Be Taught?](http://simonrogers.net/2015/01/16/can-data-journalism-be-taught/), along with his [Data Journalism syllabus](http://simonrogers.github.io/datajournalism/).
- Derek Willis can practice and teach data journalism. His Georgetown [Data Reporting syllabus](http://dwillis.github.io/data-reporting/).
- Dan Nguyen's NYU [Data Journalism syllabus](http://www.smalldatajournalism.com/class/).
- Matt Waite always does interesting work. Here is his [Data Journalism syllabus](https://github.com/mattwaite/JOUR407-Data-Journalism) and [Math for Beginning Reporters](https://github.com/mattwaite/MathForBeginningReporters), both at GitHub.
- Investigative Reporters & Editors (IRE) put together [a list of data journalism syllabi](https://ire.org/resource-center/educators-center/syllabi/), now a bit dated.
- [Making Sense of Data](https://datasense.withgoogle.com/course). Google's course on preparing, analyzing and applying data.
- A special 2016 issue of the academic journal, *Journalism*, was devoted to [Data and Statistics in Journalism and Journalism Education](http://jou.sagepub.com/content/17/1.toc)
- [Intro to Data Mashing and Map Making with Google Fusion](http://www.smalldatajournalism.com/projects/one-offs/mapping-with-fusion-tables/?utm_content=buffer8c5f4&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer). Long tutorial by Dan Nguyen with explanation of working with data in Google spreadsheets.
